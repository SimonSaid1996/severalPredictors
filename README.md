# severalPredictors
from the writer Ziran Cao
readers note:
several days ago, i was required to write code about some predictors with some degree of good speed and accuracy.
i eventually choosed to write an ELM predictor(simplified version of BP neuro network), a GriderSearch machine(basically SVM)
and a GA_ELM machine( basically a simplified version of MEA-BP network)

the code is mostly complete, the GA_ELM_findweightNThreash section might need a little more work to improve it, otherwise the rest
parts are fine
